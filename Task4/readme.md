# Task 4: ðŸ§  Build a TypeScript Generic Repository System (Full CRUD)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Design and implement a generic, type-safe repository pattern in TypeScript to manage static in-memory data. You will apply **generics**, **interfaces**, and **inheritance**, while simulating typical backend logic.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What You'll Build

- A generic repository interface that supports **CRUD + filtering**
- A base repository class that implements this interface
- Three separate model repositories that inherit from the base
- Static data for testing each model
- A script that tests and logs each method

---

## ðŸ“‹ Task Requirements

### 1. Define These Three Data Models

- **User**, **Course**, and **Booking**  
- Each model must include an `id` as required and a few relevant properties.

---

### 2. Create a Generic Repository Interface

The interface must define the following methods, all returning **Promises**:

- Fetch all items  
- Fetch one item by ID  
- Create a new item  
- Update an existing item  
- Delete an item by ID  
- Find items by filter (using partial fields)  

---

### 3. Implement a Generic Base Repository Class

This class must:

- Accept any model type that includes an `id` field  
- Store data in-memory (array)  
- Implement all interface methods in a generic, reusable way  

---

### 4. Implement Model-Specific Repositories

Create one class per model that **extends the base repository**. Each class:

- Should pass static data to the base class  
- May include additional methods (**optional**)  

---

### 5. Seed Static Data

Each repository instance must be initialized with **at least 2â€“3 sample records**.  
Use this data to simulate real-world behavior in your tests.

---

### 6. Test the Full Flow

In a separate script:

- Create each repository instance  
- Test and log the output of each method defined in the interface  
- Ensure results are **type-safe** and **async-compatible**
